# HEALTHCARE INSURANCE FRAUD DETECTION #

## Problem Statement:
Healthcare insurance fraud results in substantial financial losses each year. Manual fraud detection processes are time-consuming, inconsistent and prone to error, making automated and scalable solutions essential.

## Solution Provided: 
This project formulates fraud detection as a binary classification problem, where insurance claims are classified as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. A Logistic Regression model is used as the baseline. To improve performance, a Random Forest Classifier is trained, achieving an accuracy of 90% and a recall of 82%, with particular emphasis on recall due to the importance of correctly identifying fraudulent claims.
